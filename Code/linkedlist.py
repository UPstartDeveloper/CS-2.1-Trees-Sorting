           Best case running time: O(1)
           This function mimics the approach of the prepend and append methods
           in several scenarios: if we are inserting an item at the head node
           position (which is index 0), this uses the runtime of the prepend
           method; or if we inserting at the tail node, or we are inserting an
           item into a list with no other items, this method uses the same
           runtime as the append operation (in the latter case, the index
           would also be equal to 0). Furthermore, this method also runs in
           constant time if the index is out of range, in which it takes
           constant time to raise tbe ValueError.

           Worst case running time: O(n)
           If we are inserting an item at an index position that cannot be
           considered the head nor the tail, then we have a variable number
           of items to iterate over. In the worst case scenario, the index we
           want to insert at is just before the tail, meaning we need n-1
           iterations through the for loop (found in the else block below),
           where n is the number of items in the list. The runtime in this
           scenario scales in linear time to the growth of the list, therefore
           we disregard the -1 and are left with O(n) runtime.
